# Open Debate

This is a Jekyll-based debate platform that follows the rules of a [Oxford-style debate](https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/oxford) with some slight modifications.


It [has a link](https://celadon-douhua-b296d0.netlify.app/), but it is non-function by now.
